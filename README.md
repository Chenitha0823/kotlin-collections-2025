# Kotlin Collection

Most programming languages have collection-type data structures. Sometimes these are called **arrays**, sometimes **lists**. Many also have other types of collections like **maps** or **dictionaries**.

Kotlin had a rich set of collection types, both mutable (able to grow/shrink as needed) and immutable (fixed in size)

The main Kotlin collection type we need to know is the [MutableList](https://kotlinlang.org/api/core/kotlin-stdlib/kotlin.collections/-mutable-list/)
